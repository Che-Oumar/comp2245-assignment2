      <h2>The Challenge of ICPC</h2>

        ICPC is one of the toughest competitions for university students. It pushes participants to their limits by combining teamwork, pressured problem solving and continuous rapid iteration of code if the logic fails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competing in ICPC has taught me more than just algorithmsâ€”it has taught discipline, collaboration, and resilience against having your code do the sample question correct but still be wrong. The stress of debugging under the ticking clock with teammates is unmatched, and each contest is a valuable learning experience for the entire team involved.

       Do you have any idea how vertices are meant to actually create 3D objects? I dont but hey sometimes the models look good.
      </p>
      <p>
        My coding sessions are often derailed with 3D modeling, writing, or exploring half-baked game ideas. This balance messes with my focus and often leads to issues with actual assignments, it is by the grace of god that I have managed my courses well thus far.
